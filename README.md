# Diksiyonaryo

A simple dictionary website made in Express. This serves as my submission for a capstone project from Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Dev course, primarily applying what I've learned on using APIs.

## How to open site
1. Clone this repository
2. CD into root directory and use the command **npm install**
3. Open the website through the command **nodemon index.js** and type in the URL http://localhost:3000/
